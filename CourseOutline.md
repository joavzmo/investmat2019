Invited lecture, part of the course [Mathematical Modeling in the Industry](https://www.upv.es/pls/oalu/sic_asi.Busca_Asi?p_codi=33202&p_caca=2017&P_IDIOMA=c&p_vista=MSE&p_tit=2199) of the [MSc in Mathematical Research](http://www.investmat.org/) at [Universitat Politècnica de València](http://www.upv.es/).


## Introduction: mathematical engineering in the industry
  * Personal background
  * What is mathematical engineering?
  * What do I do at [DRiV](https://www.driv.com/)?
  * Transitioning from the Academia to the Industry
    
## Main workshop: modeling and control of a vehicle suspension

### System modeling

### System analysis

### PID controller design

### Root locus controller design

### Frequency response controller design

### State-space controller design

### Simulink modeling

### Simulink controller design

### Main reference

  * Bill Messner & Dawn Tilbury, Control Tutorials for Matlab and Simulink (http://ctms.engin.umich.edu/CTMS/index.php?example=Suspension&section=SystemModeling)

## The real deal at work
  * Suspension models and the meaning of model-based development and system identification
  * Vehicle models and the importance of the research question
  * Road input, maneuvers and the role of standards
  * Controller development and the interplay between science and technology

## Conclusion: the discovery of the inerter
  * What is an inerter and how come no one had done this before?
  * You have a useful set of skills to succeed, but people do not know
  * Final advice
    * Do stuff (Driving for results, Planning and Organizing, Communication)
    * Be nice (Building Trusting Relationships, Coaching)
    * Keep learning (Technical/Professional knowledge and skills)
