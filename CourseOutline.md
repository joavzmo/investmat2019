October 2019

Invited lecture, part of the course [Mathematical Modeling in the Industry](https://www.upv.es/pls/oalu/sic_asi.Busca_Asi?p_codi=33202&p_caca=2017&P_IDIOMA=c&p_vista=MSE&p_tit=2199) of the [MSc in Mathematical Research](http://www.investmat.org/) at [Universitat Politècnica de València](http://www.upv.es/).


## 1 - Introduction: mathematical engineering in the industry
  * Personal background
  * What is mathematical engineering?
  * What do I do at [DRiV](https://www.driv.com/)?
  * Transitioning from the Academia to the Industry
     * Yearly objectives, performance reviews, development plans
     * Working with others (other colleagues, other departments, other companies)
    
## 2 - Workshop: modeling and control of a vehicle suspension

**Main reference**: Bill Messner & Dawn Tilbury, [Control Tutorials for Matlab and Simulink](http://ctms.engin.umich.edu/CTMS/index.php?example=Suspension&section=SystemModeling)
  
### 2.1 - System modeling

### 2.2 - System analysis

### 2.3 - PID controller design

### 2.4 - Root locus controller design

### 2.5 - Frequency response controller design

### 2.6 - State-space controller design

### 2.7 - Simulink modeling

### 2.8 - Simulink controller design

## 3 - The real deal at work
  * Suspension models and the meaning of model-based development and system identification
  * Vehicle models and the importance of the research question
  * Road input, maneuvers and the role of standards
  * Controller development and the interplay between science and technology

## 4 - Conclusion: the discovery of the inerter
  * What is an inerter and how come no one had done this before?
  * You have a useful set of skills to succeed, but people do not know
  * Final advice
    * Do useful stuff (Driving for results, Planning and Organizing, Communication)
    * Be nice (Building Trusting Relationships, Coaching)
    * Keep learning (Technical/Professional knowledge and skills)
